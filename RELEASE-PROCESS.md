# Release process

## Versioning
Semantic versioning should be used, eg 1.2.3.

## Tag
The tag should be of the form v{version}.

## Creating a release 
- In GitHub, go to releases.
- Select `Draft a new release`.
- Choose a tag - you can create a new tag here. Make sure it is the same as the version in `setup.py`.
- Click `Generate release ntoes`.
- Make sure `Set as latest release` is selected.
- Click `Publish release`.

- Creating a release in GitHub automatically triggers publication on PyPI.
